<h1 align = "center"> GSS Participation Satifiscation Survey: Analysis </h1>


    
**Note:** 
- In the instance that the data was to be imported to PostgreSQL, I create a Python script to import the sample dataset into the desired database.  
- Feasibility of importing excel files into Tableau public was straightforward.

## Introduction:
---
    
Through the analysis of the raw data given, I would create visualizations, with the use of particular tools, to ease the process of displaying the desired data in a variety of graphs. After this, I will be able to conclude from the data visuals.
    
## Goal:
---
    
Draw conclusions and analysis from visualized data.

---    
### Tools Used
---

- SQL (PostgreSQL, pgadmin4):
- Python (Pandas, SQLAlchemy):
- Tableau Public(Data visualization):
- Excel Spreadsheets and Word

### Analysis
---

#### Grouped Survey Data

-	First 5 questions: Grouped by the 'Race' column
- Questions 6 through 10: Grouped by the 'Student Grade' column
- Questions 11 through 14: Grouped by the 'Gender' column



---
### Findings
---

- It's evident that Good Shepherd Services, GSS, represents more of the underrepresented communities. In my finding, the majority of the surveyed were between two race groups: 'Hispanic/Latino' with 43%; and 'African American/Black/Caribbean' with 29%. That's not to diminish the representation of other race groups in the dataset.
- The programs with the most survey responses: Program I, J, and Q, in no particular order.
- There's a clear contrast between satisfied and unsatisfied participants of the afterschool program: The majority of the surveyed fell in 'Strongly Agree' and 'Agreed' or 'All of the time' and 'Most of the Time.'


---
#### Data-Driven Decision
---

- The sample dataset reveals that most of the afterschool participants are happy, but that's not to say we can look further into why some groups of people felt dissatisfied or unpleased. Not enough data to reveal causation.
-	The  majority of the afterschool participants categorize into the minority groups; we can further continue to discover ways expand/grow the orgnization. For example, to improve retention rates--I cannot make inferences on retention rate; further organization research would be required.
